    "# Fractional hybridization of Carbon atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates how to compute hybridization indexes of C atoms from xyz structure files of molecular systems using few lines of Python code. Some of the functions defined below are re-usable for other purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let review some basic concepts about hybridization. Let consider a C atom using some kind of $sp^{\\tau}$ hybrid orbitals to form $\\sigma$ bonds with the neighboring substituents. The (unnormalized) hybrids can be represented in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "|\\psi_i \\rangle = |s\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\tau_i}|p\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|s\\rangle$ describes a (total-symmetric) $s$ orbital and $|p\\rangle$ a directional $p$-orbital, while\n",
    "$\\tau_i$ is the fraction of $p$ character of the hybrid, a.k.a. the *hybridization index*. Notice that $|s\\rangle$, $|p\\rangle$ represent a basis in which the hybrid orbital is expanded; $|p\\rangle$, being a directional orbital, can be further expanded in the local basis $|p_x\\rangle, |p_y\\rangle, |p_z\\rangle$. Assuming\n",
    "orthogonality w.r.t. to the scalar product defined in the Hilbert space $H$ spanned by the hybrids, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\langle \\psi_i | \\psi_j \\rangle = 1 + \\sqrt{\\tau_i \\tau_j}\\cos(\\theta_{ij}) = \\delta_{ij}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the hypothesis of non-bent bonds, $\\theta_{ij}$ are the corresponding bond angles. Therefore, the hybridization indexes $\\tau_i$ can be computed directly from the geometry around the C atom as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\boxed{\\cos(\\theta_{ij}) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\tau_i\\tau_j}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation defines a system of three equations in three unknowns (namely $\\tau_i$), which can be easily solved to give:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\boxed{\\tau_i = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{jk})}{\\cos(\\theta_{ij})\\cos(\\theta_{ik})}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with $i\\neq j \\neq k$. Notice that for the $\\pi$-like orbital we may write:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "|\\psi_{\\pi}\\rangle = |s\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\lambda} |p\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "thus defining three additional equations of the same type as above, involving the angles $(\\theta_{1\\pi}, \\theta_{2\\pi}, \\theta_{3\\pi})$. The problem is only apparently overdetermined because the orientation of the fourth orbital actually follows from orthogonality once the orientation of the first three is given (a\n",
    "consequence of having a 4-dimensional function space in 3-dimensional Euclidean space). The hybridization index â€‚ for the $\\pi$-like orbital can thus be obtained by the conservation of $p$ (or $s$) weights upon hybridization. The latter simply follows from the condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^3 ||\\psi_i||^2 + ||\\psi_{\\pi}||^2 = 1\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "which leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\boxed{ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{1-\\sum_i(1+\\tau_i)^{-1}} -1 }\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "which is singular ($\\lambda \\to + \\infty$) for co-planar $\\sigma$-bonds, i.e. when $\\tau_i = 2$, for $i = 1{-}3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the above derived equations to compute the hybridization indexes of C atoms of a given molecule from its geometrical structure as given by the xyz file. The steps required for such computation are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the xyz file\n",
    "2. For each atom, find its nearest-neighbors (i.e. its substituents)\n",
    "3. Compute the corresponding bond angles\n",
    "4. Compute the hybridization indexes from the bond angles\n",
